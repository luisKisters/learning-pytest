# Learning Pytest

This repository contains my personal notes and code as I learn how to use the [pytest](https://pytest.org) testing framework. I am following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/YbpKMIUjvK8) to learn the basics of pytest.

As part of my learning process, I have implemented a bubble sort algorithm in Python using [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/g_xesqdQqvA) as a guide. I am using pytest to write and run tests for my bubble sort implementation to ensure that it works correctly.
